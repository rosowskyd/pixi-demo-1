### The purpose of this assignment

The purpose of the assignment is to show off your skills, both in terms of how you solve a problem and how you structure code within the existing codebase. Additionally, you can demonstrate your eye for visual design (layout, animations). 

The main focus of this assignment is to check your ability to write clean, well-structured and reusable code. Please be prepared to discuss the new code you wrote during the interview process.

### Create one additional game element

You will create one additional game element, incorporating at least one new animation. You can use any available resources on the web.

### Bonus assignment (optional)

Re-write the game in TypeScript.

### Deploy game

Build and deploy game to any environment that will allow it to be reviewed. GitHub is a fine option.

## Project build
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
This command creates the build for production and saves the created build's files in the dist/ folder.
